title: HW9 User Testing
---
We did some tests with few users. Test was almost similar to what we described in earlier assingment. Each user was given some text to type on a computer. Each user was asked to type the text two time , one withthout feedback and once with feedback. While the user was typing in the text our device was recoring how good/bad their posture was at any time. Following are some plots based on the data we collected.
