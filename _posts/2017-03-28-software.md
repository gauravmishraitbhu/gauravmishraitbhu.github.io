The task at hand was create the software component of the project. For our project the software component's role is just to display data and give user feedback about how good / bad their posture has been over a period of time. The UI doesnt have any user interactions other than displaying data.<br/> The only interaction that current UI allows is to zoom in the timeline(x-axis) to view a range of time.

<h2>Data to be Visualized </h2>
The UI which is currently a web application shows 2 types of information. 
1) At any given time for what percentage of last minute user was in good posture. For example if user was in bad posture for total of 20 secs in last minute then current reading will be 66.66 .

2) Rating computed from the time series data and some simple heuristics which takes into account that user was in bad posture for small durations or large durations. For example if in one scenario during a minute user was in bad posture for continuous 10 secs and in other scenario user was in bad posture for 10 secs but not continuos , then the first scenario will be pernalized more. 

<h2>Components</h2>
There are 3 component involved in the whole data visualization.  <br/>
1) Arduino - will collect the data from sensors and aggregate the data. <br/>
2) Laptop - will collect data from Arduino and do the necessary processing so that UI (browser) can display the data. <br/>
3) Web Browser - pulls the processed data from server hosted on Laptop. <br/>

<h2>Communication</h2>
The communication between sensors and arduino are done via GPIO pins. Arduino does the aggregation of data and write it to serial port. <br/>
A server running on Laptop then reads the data from the serial port and does some minor processing on data to make it suitable to be sent to web browser. <br/>
The communication between server and browser is done via websockets. The server keeps on pushing the data on socket from where client code can read it and display it.<br/>
