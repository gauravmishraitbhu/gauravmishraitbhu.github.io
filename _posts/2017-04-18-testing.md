title: HW8 Testing Methodology
---
The task at hand was to come up with a good way to test the device. The output of our device is a rating which is a running score in real time which indicates how good user's posture has been in last 10 mins. Therefore the data which we will be tracking in our tests will be average rating for a user.
<br/>
<p>
The variable which we will be controlling is the feedback part of the device. That is, in one group of user we wont give them feedback (via leds) how good/bad their posture has been. Whereas second group of users will be given the approapriate feedbacks
</p>
<p>
	Our device consists of two components , 1) The component which tracks how much user's joint is bent 2)Wrist band with leds which provides user feedback. <br/>
	For the first group of users we will just give them the first component which monitors how much a particular joint is being bent at any given time. for the second group of users we will give them both devices. The data for both these groups can be collected and compared if the average rating of second group of users is better or not.
