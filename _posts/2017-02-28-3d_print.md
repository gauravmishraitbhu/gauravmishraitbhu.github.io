The task at hand was to use use the 3d model we created in the previous assignment and 3D print it. 


 <h2> Parameters Used for Printing </h2>


 * temperature - 80 degree and 210 degree
 * Infill - 10%
 * Resolution - Low
 * No raft / Support required for the model



 <h2> Results </h2>
Following is how the 3d printed model looks.

The source file for the above model can be found <a href="https://github.com/gbangera/CSE-592/tree/master/Assignment%204%20-%20Part%201:%203D%20Design%20and%20Render%20a%20Mouse">here </a>



<h2> Remarks </h2>
 * Due to the low resolution setting used while printing the surface was not smooth.
 * Due to some issue while exporting the model some details like fillets on all corners and one extrude didnt show up in the 3d printed model.
