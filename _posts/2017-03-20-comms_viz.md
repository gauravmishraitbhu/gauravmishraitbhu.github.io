The task at hand was to kick start the implementation of the project by finalising the sensors to be used for the project and figure the way to collect data from the sensors.

<h2>Sensor</h2>
The main sensor which we are going to use is called flex sensor. This is basically a variable resistor whose resistor varies depending on how much we are bending the sensor from its neutral position.

From our experiments we found that the working range of our sensor was between 10k ohms to 60k ohms. That is in its neutral position it has resistance of about 10k ohms.

More information about the sensor can be found <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8606">here</a>


<h2>Cicuit</h2>
Our circuit was very simple voltage divider circuit with a fixed resistor and flex sensor connected in series. And we were reading the voltage across the fixed resistor.
We followed following tutorial to setup our circuit. <br/> <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sik-experiment-guide-for-arduino---v32/experiment-9-using-a-flex-sensor">Tutorial</a>

<h2>Data Collection and Visualisation</h2>
We used analog pin of arduino to get the readings from our circuit. To smoothen the readings we immplemented a simple average filter which works on a moving window. Following figure shows the plot of analog reading (range 0 - 1024) vs time. The red line is the filtered output and blue line shows the raw output.

From our experiments we found the reading of our circuit is around 450 is where the sensor is not being bent and hence it will be safe posture reading. Whereas values below 300 will be what which will trigger alerts for user to improve their posture.
